## summary

### about
  
<p>Project developed by the author "NatÃ¡lia F. Dev," I borrowed a lot from her project to develop this one. However, I made some modifications to this project. The initial project was to create a simple website with a Marvel theme, but the modification I made was to add a login and registration option. It is still in the development phase, but the idea behind it was to create a login screen for users to access the project. Note: It's likely that there will be an update to implement this part in the future. </p>
